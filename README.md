# Flight data - analysis in Python

## Project description
The goal of this project is to analyze the pricing patterns of domestic flights in India and uncover key trends based on various factors. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, the project seeks to answer how flight ticket prices fluctuate depending on:
* Airline companies
* Flight class (Economy vs Business)
* Departure and arrival times
* Source and destination cities
* Booking lead time (days left before departure)

In addition to price dynamics, the project also explores the volume and frequency of flights to highlight the most active airlines, popular routes, and busiest cities.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* `pandas` for data manipulation
* `matplotlib & `seaborn for data visualization
* Spider as the development environment
